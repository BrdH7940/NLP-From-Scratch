# NLP-From-Scratch

A personal learning project focused on implementing foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) models from scratch using NumPy.

**Models Included:**
*   Word2Vec (Skip-gram)
*   Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

**Purpose:**
The main goal of this project is educational. It serves as a hands-on exercise to:
*   Solidify understanding of fundamental NLP algorithms.
*   Strengthen knowledge of the underlying mathematics.
*   Translate theoretical concepts, such as those taught in Stanford's CS224N, into practical code.
